# Travelista â€” MERN Stack Event Management System

## Overview  
Travelista is a full-stack web application built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) and styled with TailwindCSS. It enables users to browse, book, and manage events with distinct roles for Admins and regular Users.

## Design  
The entire UI/UX design was created first using **Figma**, allowing for a clean and modern user experience that was then implemented in React with TailwindCSS.
